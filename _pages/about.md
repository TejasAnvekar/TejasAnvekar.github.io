**ðŸ‘‹Hi! I'm Tejas!** currently working as Research Assistant at [KLE Technological University](https://www.kletech.ac.in/), collaborating with [Prof. Uma Mudenagudi](https://kletech.irins.org/profile/159972#other_information_panel) @ CoE Visual Intelligence [(CEVI)](https://www.kletech.ac.in/research-innovation/research-centres/cevi). 

My research focus spans the domains of **3D Comupter Vision**, **Self-Supervised Learning**, and **Continual Learning**, with the penultimate aim of bestowing robots with a human-like perception. 

Beyond by academic endeavors, I serve as an external collaborator to distinguised scholars including [Prof. Chandra Kambhamettu](https://www.eecis.udel.edu/~chandra/) @ [VIMS Lab](https://bigdatavision.org/) &#x7c; University of Delaware and [Dr. Dena Bazazian](https://denabazazian.github.io/) @ University of Plymouth. 

I did my Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication at [KLE Technological University](https://www.kletech.ac.in/), India where I was advised by [Prof. Uma Mudenagudi](https://kletech.irins.org/profile/159972#other_information_panel) and worked on Self-Supervised geometric methods for a DST funded project to Categorize Crowdsourced data.
